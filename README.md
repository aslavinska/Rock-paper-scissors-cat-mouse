 ## Bugs 

 ### Solved bugs

1. During the development of the home page all elements were shift to the left of the page. Applying a main container to all elemnts and giving it item alligment to center resolved the issue. 
2. 404 favicon error has been detected during the development, using favicon generator images and links were imported and the issue has been resolved. 
3. The click command was not recognised by the browser, as the main function was not called.
    3.1 after calling the function got an error : Uncaught TypeError: target is undefined. In order to solve it did code refacturing, removed main function and added event listener function with init function at the end of the code. 
4. During the deployment on Github Pages the images were not loading, but the project was working great in Gitpod testing environment, after some research online it was tried to add "." before assets "src="./assets/images/mouse.png"" and the Github was able to load the images.
